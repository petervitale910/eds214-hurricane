#### Background

We have data from four river sites Quebrada Cuenca 1-3 (q1, q2, q3) and Rio Mameyes Puente Roto (mpr). We are trying to recreate this figure from Schaefer et al. (2000).

In the study they were examining the response in water chemistry following the disturbance of hurricane hugo. I'm going to start by going into the library of all the packages I will be using. I'm using the pacman package to load all of my packages, this will install the packages if you do not currently have them installed.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
pacman::p_load("tidyverse", "janitor", "here", "ggthemes", "patchwork", "ARTofR")
```

#### Data

First I read in the csv's as well as clean the names and filter for the columns (nutrients) figure 3 focused on. As well as the years we are interested in. This was done in [](). Now I call the variables.

```{r}
q1_data <- read_rds(here::here("outputs","q1_dat.rds"))

q2_data <- read_rds(here::here("outputs","q2_dat.rds"))

q3_data <- read_rds(here::here("outputs","q2_dat.rds"))

mpr_data <- read_rds(here::here("outputs","mpr_dat.rds"))
```



#### Methods

In the paper they calculated the rolling average, an average taken over a set of data points to smooth out the lines. To apply my own rolling average i am using two functions:

1.  {moving_average} : calculates the moving average for one nutrient in the data frame
2.  {df_moving_average} : calculates the moving average for multiple nutrients in a data frame

We need to source these from my *R* folder

```{r}
source(here::here("R","moving-average.R"))
```

Both functions are documented so you are able to find out more information about the inputs by going into the R folder and looking at the file moving-average.R

So now we apply that function to my four data frames.

```{r}
mpr_data <- df_moving_average(df = mpr_data, 
                            dates = sample_date,
                            chem_vec = c("k", "nh4_n", "no3_n", "mg", "ca"))

q1_data <- df_moving_average(df = q1_data, 
                           dates = sample_date,
                           chem_vec = c("k", "nh4_n", "no3_n", "mg", "ca"))

q2_data <- df_moving_average(df = q2_data, 
                           dates = sample_date,
                           chem_vec = c("k", "nh4_n", "no3_n", "mg", "ca"))

q3_data <- df_moving_average(df = q3_data, 
                           dates = sample_date,
                           chem_vec = c("k", "nh4_n", "no3_n", "mg", "ca"))
```

Now all the rolling averages have been calculated and placed in their own columns in our datasets, but we only want one dataframe to graph. So lets merge them using {rbind}

```{r}
all_river_data <- rbind(mpr_data, q1_data, q2_data, q3_data)
```

Ok now lets make some ggplots for each. We need to stack each nutrient so I'm going to be making 5 individual graphs for each of the nutrients

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| message: false
k_plot <- ggplot(all_river_data, aes(x = sample_date))+
              geom_line(aes(y = k_rolling_average, 
                            color = sample_id))+
  theme_few()+
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("1989-09-10"),
             linetype = "dotdash") +
  scale_x_date(position = "top")+
  
  labs(y = "K (mg/l)")+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 9))


no3_plot <- ggplot(all_river_data, aes(x = sample_date ))+
  geom_line(aes(y = no3_n_rolling_average, 
                color = sample_id))+
  theme_few()+
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("1989-09-10"),
             linetype = "dotdash") +
  labs(y = "NO3-N (ug/l)",
       color = "River")+
  scale_x_date()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 9))


nh4_plot <- ggplot(all_river_data, aes(x = sample_date))+
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("1989-09-10"),
             linetype = "dotdash") +
  geom_line(aes(y = nh4_n_rolling_average, 
                color = sample_id))+
  labs(y = "NH4-N (ug/l)",
       x = "Sample Date")+
  theme_few()+
  scale_x_date()+
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 9))


mg_plot <- ggplot(all_river_data, aes(x = sample_date))+
  geom_line(aes(y = mg_rolling_average, 
                color = sample_id))+
  labs (y = "Mg (mg/l)")+
  theme_few()+
  scale_x_date()+
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("1989-09-10"),
             linetype = "dotdash") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), 
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 9))
  

ca_plot <- ggplot(all_river_data, aes(x = sample_date))+
  geom_line(aes(y = ca_rolling_average,
                color = sample_id))+
  labs(y = "Ca (mg/l)")+
  theme_few()+
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("1989-09-10"),
             linetype = "dotdash") +
  scale_x_date()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), 
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 9))

total_plot <- (k_plot/no3_plot/mg_plot/ca_plot/nh4_plot)
```

Let's check in the Results section for the final graph

#### Results

Here I am using functionality from the {patchwork} package to stack all the nutrient graphs

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
total_plot+plot_annotation(
  subtitle = "Response to Hurricane disturbance in Loquillo Mountain chemestry after Hurricane Hugo (1989)",
  caption = "Dotted line represents when the Hurricane reached Puerto Rico"
  
)
```
